# Montevideo Moves: Data for Safer Mobility

This project analyzes road traffic crashes in Montevideo, Uruguay, during 2022. It was developed as part of the course *Fundamentals of Programming for Data Science and AI*, in the specialization program by UTEC and MIT.

## Objective

To explore patterns in traffic incidents involving injuries, using real-world data from the national transit system (SINATRAN), and to provide data-driven recommendations for improving urban mobility and public safety in Montevideo.

## Methods

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics
- Time series visualization
- Policy-oriented synthesis

##  Dataset

- Source: [catalogodatos.gub.uy](https://catalogodatos.gub.uy)
- Observations: 7,802
- Variables: 19 (age, gender, role, vehicle type, location, injury severity, date/time, etc.)
- Scope: All registered injury-related traffic incidents in Montevideo in 2022

## Key Findings

- Most incidents involve **men aged 23‚Äì46** riding **two-wheeled vehicles**
- **87%** of outcomes are minor injuries
- **Urban zones** and **afternoon hours** see the highest frequency
- **Collisions dominate**, often on fast-moving main roads

## Policy Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the team proposed six targeted policy measures:

1. **Safe Corridors** ‚Äì redesign high-traffic avenues with better infrastructure
2. **Time-based Controls** ‚Äì extend enforcement beyond peak hours
3. **Segmented Education** ‚Äì focus on young male riders with tailored campaigns
4. **Protected Crossings** ‚Äì improve pedestrian infrastructure
5. **Elderly Protection** ‚Äì enhance safety around vulnerable populations
6. **Driver Responsibility** ‚Äì enforce norms and promote responsible behavior
